# Rule Action Chaining

Connect rules so the output of one rule feeds into another. Use `DependsOnRuleId` to declare data-flow dependencies between independent rules.

## Parent-Child vs DependsOn

Rules engine supports two types of relationships between rules. Understanding the difference is critical for correct rule design.

### Parent-Child (Structural Nesting)

A parent rule *contains* child rules. Children are evaluated as part of the parent's evaluation. The parent succeeds only if all active children succeed.

**Use for:** Sub-conditions that compose a larger check.

```csharp
var adultCheck = new Rule
{
    Description = "Valid adult customer",
    Expression = "customer.IsAdult && customer.HasName",
    IsActive = true
};

adultCheck.ChildRules.Add(new Rule
{
    Description = "Age check",
    Expression = "customer.Age >= 18"
});

adultCheck.ChildRules.Add(new Rule
{
    Description = "Name check",
    Expression = "!string.IsNullOrEmpty(customer.Name)"
});
```

**Execution order:**
1. Age check (child)
2. Name check (child)
3. Valid adult customer (parent expression)

**Failure behavior:** If Age check fails, adultCheck fails immediately. Name check still runs (all children are evaluated).

### DependsOn (Data-Flow Dependency)

Rule B *depends on* Rule A's output. Rule B can read Rule A's result and makes its own decision. The rules remain independent — Rule A doesn't know about Rule B.

**Use for:** Multi-stage pipelines where later stages need earlier outputs.

```csharp
var validateCustomer = new Rule
{
    Description = "Validate customer",
    Expression = "customer != null && customer.IsActive",
    IsActive = true
};

var checkCredit = new Rule
{
    Description = "Check credit",
    DependsOnRuleId = validateCustomer.Id,
    Expression = "customer.CreditScore >= 700",
    IsActive = true
};
```

**Execution order:**
1. Validate customer
2. Check credit (only after validate customer completes)

**Failure behavior:** If validate customer fails, check credit still runs. Check credit can use `RuleContext` to see the dependency's result and decide what to do.

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Parent-Child | DependsOn |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Relationship | Structural containment | Data-flow dependency |
| Direction | Parent knows children | Dependent knows dependency |
| Execution | Children first, then parent | Dependency first, then dependent |
| Failure impact | Parent fails if any child fails | Dependent still runs regardless |
| Access to results | Parent cannot read child values | Dependent can read dependency values |
| Use case | Composite conditions | Multi-stage pipelines |
| Cycle detection | Child tree validation | Dependency graph validation |

## Basic Dependency

Create two rules where the second depends on the first.

```csharp
var ruleA = new Rule
{
    Description = "Calculate tax",
    Expression = "customer.Amount > 0",
    Action = "customer.TaxAmount = customer.Amount * 0.08",
    IsActive = true
};

var ruleB = new Rule
{
    Description = "Calculate total",
    DependsOnRuleId = ruleA.Id,
    Expression = "customer.TaxAmount > 0",
    Action = "customer.Total = customer.Amount + customer.TaxAmount",
    IsActive = true
};

var workflow = new Workflow
{
    Description = "Order calculation",
    Rules = new List<Rule> { ruleB, ruleA } // Any order
};

workflow.Validate();
workflow.Compile(parameters);

var results = workflow.Execute(parameters).ToList();
// results[0] = Calculate tax (dependency)
// results[1] = Calculate total (dependent)
```

## Multi-Stage Pipeline

Build a processing pipeline where each stage depends on the previous.

```csharp
// Stage 1: Validate input
var validateInput = new Rule
{
    Description = "Validate input",
    Expression = "customer != null && customer.Id > 0",
    IsActive = true
};

// Stage 2: Enrich data (fetch additional info)
var enrichData = new Rule
{
    Description = "Enrich data",
    DependsOnRuleId = validateInput.Id,
    Expression = "true",
    Action = "customer.CreditScore = CreditService.GetScore(customer.Id)",
    IsActive = true
};

// Stage 3: Evaluate risk
var evaluateRisk = new Rule
{
    Description = "Evaluate risk",
    DependsOnRuleId = enrichData.Id,
    Expression = "customer.CreditScore >= 600",
    IsActive = true
};

// Stage 4: Approve or reject
var finalDecision = new Rule
{
    Description = "Final decision",
    DependsOnRuleId = evaluateRisk.Id,
    Expression = "true",
    Action = "customer.Approved = context.GetResult(evaluateRisk.Id).Success",
    IsActive = true
};

var workflow = new Workflow
{
    Description = "Loan approval pipeline",
    Rules = new List<Rule> { finalDecision, evaluateRisk, enrichData, validateInput }
};

workflow.Validate();
workflow.Compile(parameters);

// Execute: Validate → Enrich → Evaluate → Decide
var results = workflow.Execute(parameters).ToList();
```

## Accessing Dependency Results

Use `RuleContext` to read the results of previously executed rules.

### RuleContext API

```csharp
public class RuleContext
{
    // Store a result
    void StoreResult(Guid ruleId, RuleResult result);
    
    // Retrieve a result
    RuleResult? GetResult(Guid ruleId);
    
    // Check if a rule has been executed
    bool HasResult(Guid ruleId);
    
    // Get typed value from a result
    T? GetValue<T>(Guid ruleId);
    
    // Clear all results
    void Clear();
}
```

### Reading Values in Expressions

```csharp
var calculateTax = new Rule
{
    Description = "Calculate tax",
    Expression = "true",
    Action = "customer.TaxAmount = customer.Amount * 0.08",
    IsActive = true
};

var calculateTotal = new Rule
{
    Description = "Calculate total",
    DependsOnRuleId = calculateTax.Id,
    Expression = "true",
    Action = @"customer.Total = customer.Amount + context.GetValue<decimal>(calculateTax.Id)",
    IsActive = true
};
```

### Conditional Logic Based on Dependencies

```csharp
var checkAuthentication = new Rule
{
    Description = "Check authentication",
    Expression = "customer.IsAuthenticated",
    IsActive = true
};

var checkAuthorization = new Rule
{
    Description = "Check authorization",
    DependsOnRuleId = checkAuthentication.Id,
    Expression = @"context.GetResult(checkAuth.Id).Success && customer.HasAdminRole",
    IsActive = true
};
```

## Parallel Execution with Dependencies

When using `ExecuteParallelAsync`, independent rules run concurrently while dependency chains run sequentially.

```csharp
var ruleA = new Rule { Description = "A", Expression = "true", IsActive = true };
var ruleB = new Rule { Description = "B", DependsOnRuleId = ruleA.Id, Expression = "true", IsActive = true };
var ruleC = new Rule { Description = "C", Expression = "true", IsActive = true }; // Independent
var ruleD = new Rule { Description = "D", DependsOnRuleId = ruleB.Id, Expression = "true", IsActive = true };

var workflow = new Workflow
{
    Rules = new List<Rule> { ruleA, ruleB, ruleC, ruleD }
};

workflow.Validate();
workflow.Compile(parameters);

// Execution:
// Phase 1 (parallel): ruleA, ruleC
// Phase 2 (parallel): ruleB (after A completes), ruleC already done
// Phase 3 (parallel): ruleD (after B completes)
var results = await workflow.ExecuteParallelAsync(parameters);
```

**Performance tip:** Design your rules to maximize independent rules for better parallelization.

## Validation

`Validate()` performs comprehensive dependency checking.

### Missing Dependency Detection

```csharp
var rule = new Rule
{
    Description = "Invalid rule",
    DependsOnRuleId = Guid.NewGuid(), // Non-existent rule
    Expression = "true",
    IsActive = true
};

var workflow = new Workflow { Rules = new List<Rule> { rule } };

// Throws: RuleValidationException
// "Rule 'Invalid rule' (Id: ...) depends on rule ... which does not exist or is inactive."
workflow.Validate();
```

### Circular Dependency Detection

```csharp
var ruleA = new Rule { Description = "A", Expression = "true", IsActive = true };
var ruleB = new Rule { Description = "B", DependsOnRuleId = ruleA.Id, Expression = "true", IsActive = true };

// Create cycle: A depends on B, B depends on A
ruleA.DependsOnRuleId = ruleB.Id;

var workflow = new Workflow { Rules = new List<Rule> { ruleA, ruleB } };

// Throws: CircularReferenceException
// "Dependency chain on rule 'A'"
workflow.Validate();
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Gatekeeper Pattern

Use a dependency as a gatekeeper. The dependent rule always runs but checks the gatekeeper's result.

```csharp
var gatekeeper = new Rule
{
    Description = "Feature enabled",
    Expression = "FeatureFlags.IsEnabled("PremiumFeature")",
    IsActive = true
};

var premiumCheck = new Rule
{
    Description = "Premium validation",
    DependsOnRuleId = gatekeeper.Id,
    Expression = "context.GetResult(gatekeeper.Id).Success && customer.IsPremium",
    IsActive = true
};
```

### Pattern 2: Data Enrichment Pipeline

Each stage adds data to the parameter object for subsequent stages.

```csharp
var fetchProfile = new Rule
{
    Description = "Fetch profile",
    Expression = "true",
    Action = "customer.Profile = ProfileService.Get(customer.Id)",
    IsActive = true
};

var validateProfile = new Rule
{
    Description = "Validate profile",
    DependsOnRuleId = fetchProfile.Id,
    Expression = "customer.Profile != null && customer.Profile.IsComplete",
    IsActive = true
};

var processOrder = new Rule
{
    Description = "Process order",
    DependsOnRuleId = validateProfile.Id,
    Expression = "true",
    Action = "OrderService.Process(customer)",
    IsActive = true
};
```

### Pattern 3: Branching Logic

One dependency, multiple dependents that make different decisions.

```csharp
var eligibilityCheck = new Rule
{
    Description = "Eligibility",
    Expression = "customer.Age >= 18 && customer.Income > 30000",
    IsActive = true
};

var standardOffer = new Rule
{
    Description = "Standard offer",
    DependsOnRuleId = eligibilityCheck.Id,
    Expression = "context.GetResult(eligibility.Id).Success && customer.Income < 100000",
    IsActive = true
};

var premiumOffer = new Rule
{
    Description = "Premium offer",
    DependsOnRuleId = eligibilityCheck.Id,
    Expression = "context.GetResult(eligibility.Id).Success && customer.Income >= 100000",
    IsActive = true
};
```

### Pattern 4: Error Handling Chain

Propagate errors through the dependency chain.

```csharp
var parseInput = new Rule
{
    Description = "Parse input",
    Expression = "int.TryParse(customer.AgeInput, out var age)",
    Action = "customer.ParsedAge = age",
    IsActive = true
};

var validateAge = new Rule
{
    Description = "Validate age",
    DependsOnRuleId = parseInput.Id,
    Expression = @"context.GetResult(parse.Id).Success && customer.ParsedAge >= 18",
    IsActive = true
};

var processAdult = new Rule
{
    Description = "Process adult",
    DependsOnRuleId = validateAge.Id,
    Expression = @"context.GetResult(validateAge.Id).Success",
    Action = "customer.IsAdult = true",
    IsActive = true
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Rule depends on rule ... which does not exist"

**Cause:** `DependsOnRuleId` points to a rule not in the workflow, or the dependency is inactive.

**Fix:** Ensure the dependency rule is added to the workflow and `IsActive = true`.

### "Dependency cycle detected"

**Cause:** Circular dependency chain (A → B → C → A).

**Fix:** Redesign rules to break the cycle. Use parent-child relationships for tight coupling instead.

### "Expected dependency result but context was empty"

**Cause:** Rule is trying to access `context.GetResult()` but the dependency hasn't executed yet.

**Fix:** Ensure `DependsOnRuleId` is set correctly. The workflow engine executes dependencies first automatically.

### Priority not respected

**Cause:** Dependency ordering overrides priority.

**Fix:** This is by design. Dependencies always execute first. Priority only affects ordering within the same dependency level.
